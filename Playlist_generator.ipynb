    "Creating the perfect playlist is never an easy task, and even harder once you want it to match with your current mood. Some songs have features such as tempo, energy or rythm that make it more suitable for dancing or to lay in your bed thinking about all the things you need to do. Platforms such as Spotify provide access to millions of songs at our fingertips, making the process of playlist creation even more challenging. In this project, we try to use the power of otimization algorithms to generate playlist that are according to the vital need of the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating a playlist is subjective and personal and therefore there is not a perfect playlist to be created, but obtaining a collection of several good playlists. With that in mind we decided to implement stochastic algorithms and therefore introduce an element of randomness and exploration, allowing for the discovery of unique combinations of songs and enhancing the overall playlist creation process. The chosen algorithms were: Genetic Algorithm (GA), a population-based method that tries to refine a population of playlists over several generations by adding some changes (mutations) and selecting the most optimal playlists (selection) ; and Simulated Annealing (SA), which is a probabilistic method that plays with the balance of exploration and exploitation, letting the algorithm to escape from local optima in the search of the global optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The songs dataset employed in this project was procured from Spotify's API, and it comprises a multitude of musical attributes for each track. We focus on three attributes that we thought could be the most representative of somebody’s mood: valence, energy, and popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <i>Valence:</i> With values in the range 0 to 100, it captures the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Songs with high valence sound more positive, while low valence tracks sound more negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <i>Energy:</i> With values from 0 to 100, it represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Energetic tracks often feel fast, loud, and noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <i>Popularity:</i> A measure from 0 to 100 representing the overall popularity of a track, based on the total number of plays and the recency of those plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "These attributes, along with the track length, are vital for assessing the appropriateness of a track for inclusion in the playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to find an optimal set of songs that minimizes the total difference in these attributes from user-defined target values, while ensuring the total duration of the playlist falls within acceptable bounds. Consequently, the problem transforms into a multi-objective optimization problem, solved using our chosen algorithms. Our goal is to find the best balance between the theoretical benefits of these algorithms and the practical considerations of music playlist generation.\n",

    "Our first step was exploring our data collection options from music streaming platforms. Among the popular ones Spotify was the only one with a useful and free API (Web API | Spotify for Developers, n.d.). The API was a hard one to use in Python without the help of a package called Spotipy (Spotipy, 2014/2023). Spotipy allowed us to navigate the authorization process of Spotify API with ease. Even though we decided to make our app work dynamicllay and pull data from Spotify on the go, this process was impossible without our application being published. This publication process requires permits from Spotify itself. Therefore we have dicided to work with pre-downloaded songs. We have written a script that downloads information on 100 songs for every genre available in Spotify.\n",

    "Simulated Annealing (SA) is an optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. SA starts with an initial random solution and iteratively explores the search space to find an optimal solution. Unlike genetic algorithms, SA does not rely on a population of solutions but rather focuses on a single solution at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This technique employs the fitness function to quantify how well the solution satisfies the desired values. During the iterative process, SA allows for both uphill and downhill moves and explores neighboring solutions by perturbing the current solution. The perturbation involves adding or deleting songs depending on whether the playlist’s length is much bigger or lower than the desired length, or by swapping songs if the playlist has a length within the range of 1 minute under or above the desired length.\n",
    "\n",
    "SA also incorporates a temperature parameter that controls the acceptance of uphill moves. Initially, the temperature is high, allowing for more exploratory moves, including accepting solutions with worse objective function values. As the algorithm progresses, the temperature gradually decreases, reducing the acceptance of suboptimal solutions and guiding the search towards the optimal solution. The cooling parameter determines the rate at which the temperature decreases. By adjusting the cooling schedule, SA can strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, improving the chances of finding an optimal playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative process of SA continues until a stopping criterion is met, in our case, reaching a stopping temperature value. Throughout the iterations, SA aims to converge towards the best solution playlist found so far, optimizing the composition of the playlist according to the desired values.\n",

    "Here we can see how both algorithms converge on the long run. Even though both algorithms converge on a similar value we can see that SA converges more consistently and also with a lower score. GA's wide base of possible solutions allows for extensive exploration of the solution space. But GA has a tendency to converge early and get stuck in a local minimum. This can be due to multiple reasons. In our case this is probably due to the lack of diversity in populations due to number of songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "SA, on the other hand, works on a single solution. Even though this might seem like it would diminish the exploration capacity of SA, acceptance of worse solutions in the initial steps actually increase the exploration capacity by a wide margin. As the exploration widens the solution space at the high temperature steps, the focus on better solutions at the low temperature steps allows the algorithm to hone on the best-found solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both algorithms are stochastic in nature. We think that this is important in a task such as playlist creation. But it is also the reason for not finding an exact optimum solution for the task. But in our case optimum solutions would create identical playlists. And a playlist recommendation tool which always recommends the same songs wouldn't be too popular.\n",

    "After running each method for 150 iterations, we observe that both algorithms ouput comparable results, although SA outperforms GA by generating slightly better-fitted playlists. However, as previously commented, one advantageous aspect of GA lies in its capability to produce a population of random playlists. While these playlists may not have the highest fitness score, they maintain an acceptable level of quality. This ability to generate multiple diverse individuals may be preferred by users over obtaining a single better-fitted playlist. Ultimately, the choice between SA and GA depends on the specific needs and preferences of the users, considering factors such as the desired level of optimization and the importance of playlist diversity.\n",
